# e-commerce-client
An e-commerce web app using **Node**, **Express**, **React** and **MongoDB** (**MERN** stack).

This repo only contains the **Frontend** i.e. the **React** part of the project.
The **backend** code is in this repo: [e-commerce-server](https://github.com/prakhar308/e-commerce-server)

Quick start
--------

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** and **MongoDB** installed.

2. Start Node server:
    ```bash
    # Get the latest snapshot
    git clone https://github.com/prakhar308/e-commerce-server.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

    # Change directory
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

    # Install NPM dependencies
    npm install

    # Then simply start your app
    npm run dev
    ```
    This would run your server on PORT 3001.

3. Start React Frontend:
    ```bash
    # Get the latest snapshot
    git clone https://github.com/prakhar308/e-commerce-client.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

    # Change directory
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

    # Install NPM dependencies
    npm install

    # Then simply start your app
    npm start
    ```
    This would run your client on PORT 3000.
